      <h3>Factors Affecting Growth</h3>

      <p>
        Microbial growth is only possible when all essential nutrients are
        provided and chemical and environmental conditions are met. Yet, there
        is a range of conditions that a species can live in. Therefore, their
        growth will be influenced by these factors. For instance, the
        temperature, pH, and oxygen level are some of the environmental factors
        that will affect their growth. On the other hand, the presence and
        availability of certain nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur,
        will also influence their growth, as well as the competition for
        nutrients with other microorganisms if present.
      </p>

      <h3>Temperature</h3>

      <p>
        As in a chemical reaction, microorganisms have a minimum, optimal, and
        maximum temperature when growing. As expected, growth will be maximal
        at an optimal temperature, and on the contrary growth will stop beyond
        the minimal and maximal temperatures. These values vary depending on
        the microbial species. In the specific case of bacteria, they can be
        classified into three groups: mesophiles, for bacteria able to grow at
        medium temperatures (usually between 25°C and 40°C), psychrophiles, for
        bacteria able to grow at low temperatures (usually between 0°C and
        20°C), and thermophiles, for bacteria able to grow at high temperatures
        (usually between 50°C and 60°C).
      </p>

      <h3>pH</h3>

      <p>
        pH affects the synthesis and structure of fundamental macromolecules
        for growth like DNA, proteins, and lipids. Thus, the acidity or
        basicity of the environment described by the pH also affects microbial
        growth. There are three main classifications in the case of bacteria
        according to their pH preferences: neutrophiles (grow at neutral pH),
        acidophiles (grow at very acidic pH: &lt; 5.5), and alkaliphiles
        (growth at very alkaline pH: &gt; 8.5).
      </p>

      <h3>Oxygen Level</h3>

      <p>
        Aerobic species will only grow in the presence of oxygen; they obtain
        energy through aerobic respiration and use oxygen as the terminal
        electron acceptor. On the other hand, obligate anaerobic species will
        only grow when oxygen is not present; they obtain energy through
        fermentation and use organic or inorganic compounds as a terminal
        electron acceptor. Moreover, facultative anaerobic species will grow
        with or without oxygen.
      </p>

      <h3>Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur and Phosphorus Sources</h3>

      <p>
        For microorganisms to be able to duplicate, they have to synthesize new
        cell components and macromolecules. Carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and
        phosphorus sources are fundamental, they provide the chemical elements
        that are necessary for building cellular structures and support
        metabolic pathways. How microbes obtain these nutrients varies between
        species. For example, in the case of bacteria, they can obtain carbon
        from organic sources (chemoheterotrophs) or carbon dioxide
        (chemoautotrophs and photoautotrophs), nitrogen can be obtained from
        proteins or the atmosphere (nitrogen-fixing bacteria), sulfur can be
        obtained from proteins, sulfates, and hydrogen sulfide and phosphorus
        can be obtained from inorganic phosphate salts or buffers.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of the environmental factors explained above will be important when
        setting up the right laboratory conditions that allow microbial growth
        under in vitro conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods of Culture</h2>

      <p>
        In general, the methods of culture and experimental set-ups differ
        depending on the objective of the specific experiment but as a general
        rule, all types of cultures should be mixed, homogenized, and in
        equilibrium with the gas phase. However, cultivating microorganisms in
        the laboratory is a much more difficult task given the difficulty to
        provide all the nutrients and environmental conditions needed to grow.
        This often makes cultivation challenging, time-consuming, and
        labor-intensive. There are mainly three culture or fermentation
        techniques widely used to grow microbial populations in vitro: batch,
        fed-batch, and continuous fermentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Batch Fermentation</h3>

      <p>
        A batch fermentation is a closed-culture system, this means that it
        contains a fixed volume of nutrients or substrates in the medium. After
        the microbial cells are inoculated into the culture medium, they will
        grow until all the nutrients are depleted. At the same time that
        nutrients are consumed, metabolic byproducts and waste materials will
        accumulate in the culture flask. As mentioned before, some microbial
        organisms like bacteria cultivated in a batch reactor usually follow
        the four phases of growth described above: lag, exponential,
        stationary, and decline phase.
      </p>

      <h3>Fed-batch Fermentation</h3>

      <p>
        A fed-batch fermentation is considered a modification from the common
        batch culture. Initially, the fed-batch fermentation operates in the
        same way as the batch fermentation until the culture reaches the end of
        the exponential phase. To extend the exponential phase, the reactor
        will be supplemented with a controlled feeding of nutrients, this
        feeding will extend the log phase resulting in an increased growth . As
        in the case of batch fermentation, byproducts will accumulate.
      </p>

      <h3>Continuous Fermentation</h3>

      <p>
        A continuous fermentation is characterized by the constant addition of
        new nutrients to the system while at the same time, the old culture
        broth is removed. The vessel used to grow a continuous culture is
        called a chemostat. In a chemostat, nutrients are continuously
        refreshed, while medium waste products and cells are continuously
        removed at the same time, resulting in wash-out if species do not
        divide fast enough. Because the influx and outflow rates are constant,
        the volume in a continuous culture is constant as well. The maximum
        working volume of the vessel will not limit the influx of new medium
        entering as in the case of the fed-batch fermentation. The influx of
        substrates and flow rate in a chemostat can be used to control the
        growth rate and the number of cells as well as expanding the
        exponential phase. Given that in a chemostat there is a constant influx
        and outflow of medium, a steady state (no increase or decrease in the
        number of cells) will be achieved when the growth rate is equal to the
        flow rate.
      </p>

      <h2>Quantification of Microbial Cultures</h2>

      <p>
        Quantifying the number of cells over a period of time allows a better
        understanding of how the specific population grows, reaches a maximum
        density, and declines. This also allows to calculate the growth rate
        and with it gain insights about the growth kinetics. This information
        is important to understand how microorganisms behave for different pH
        and temperature values, or nutrients available. In co-cultures, more
        than one microbial strain is cultivated in the same medium
        simultaneously. This allows us to study mutualistic and antagonistic
        interactions between these strains, as well as their dynamics.
        Quantification is crucial not only to assess microbial growth but also
        to prepare the inoculum samples. Different techniques have been
        developed to quantify microbial cells in a sample. All of these
        quantify cells in different units (Table below) and have different
        characteristics as discussed below.

      <h3>Direct Microscopic Count</h3>

      <p>
        This technique involves counting directly the number of cells by
        placing a small volume of the sample of interest into a hemocytometer.
        This instrument consists of a thick glass microscope slide with a
        rectangular grid that facilitates the counting, depending on the cell
        size different grids can be used. Using this method provides an easy,
        low-cost way to count cells without the need for incubation. On the
        other hand, it can be susceptible to human errors given the
        difficulties of counting under a microscope.
      </p>

      <h3>Colony Forming Units (CFU)</h3>

      <p>
        The Colony Forming Units (CFU) are a direct measurement of the number
        of viable cells in a sample. The method consists of diluting the sample
        of interest a given number of times, usually in a 1:10 ratio. This
        procedure is known as serial dilution and it helps to better count the
        number of CFUs in the sample. After each dilution, the diluted samples
        will be placed and incubated in different agar plates to allow the
        colonies to grow. Once the incubation time finishes the number of
        colonies present in the agar plate is counted and the number of cells
        is calculated depending on the specific dilution factor and volume of
        the original sample.
      </p>

      <h3>Optical Density (OD)</h3>

      <p>
        To avoid counting CFUs, another technique used to quantify growth is to
        measure the cell’s density by using a spectrophotometer. When a
        microbial culture is placed in a cuvette and a beam of light passes
        through it, the light beam will be scattered by the bacterial cells.
        How the beam scatters depends directly on the cell density and at the
        same time the cell density is proportional to the number of cells. If
        in a sample the number of microorganisms increases, so does the the
        cell density and this is reflected in the turbidity of the sample,
        which is also known as optical density (OD). In this way, a
        spectrophotometer is used to measure the absorbance of light by the
        bacterial sample at a specific wavelength. Using the resulting OD
        values to calculate the cell concentration is only possible if a
        calibration curve (OD values versus known cell concentrations) is
        available. In practice, the reading will highly depend on the
        wavelength used, how the light interacts with the sample (e.g. direct,
        reflected, etc.), the microbial strain, and if there is any light
        absorption by the medium instead of the cells. Although this method
        provides an indirect growth measurement, it is one of the most common
        techniques given its simplicity and speed.
      </p>

      <h3>Flow Cytometry (FC)</h3>

      <p>
        By using a flow cytometer different physical and chemical properties
        can be accurately measured in individual cells. The sample of interest
        is injected into a buffered saline solution also known as sheath fluid
        allowing the sample to run through the flow cytometer in a laminar
        flow. Each of the cells in the fluid sample passes by a beam of laser
        light and scatters light, which is collected by photodetectors. If the
        cell carries fluorophores, they can be excited by the laser light and
        emit light that is also collected. The scattered light is measured from
        two different angles: Forward Scatter (FSC) which is proportional to
        the cell size and Side Scatter (SSC) which relates to the cell’s
        internal complexity
      </p>

      <h3>16S rRNA gene sequencing</h3>

      <p>
        The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is a highly conserved region within
        the prokaryotic genome that contains nine hypervariable regions (V1–V9)
        interspersed between highly conserved ones. These variable regions
        within the 16S rRNA gene provide considerable sequence diversity among
        different microbial taxa and in this way provide phylogenetic
        information and allow the classification of microbial taxa. The
        resulting sequences represent the relative abundances of taxa in
        microbial communities that were present in the original sample. After
        preprocessing the sequence reads, these are grouped with a certain
        level of divergence (usually around 97% identical) and form Operational
        Taxonomic Units (OTUs). The final result usually will be a count table,
        from which relative abundances can be obtained. Although 16S rRNA gene
        sequencing does not produce a direct count of the number of microbial
        cells in a sample it is of high relevance for the study of microbial
        communities. The quantification of the relative abundances of different
        taxa at once allows the analysis of the distribution of microbes and
        provides information about the structure and dynamics of microbial
        communities.

      <p>
        Given that µGrowthDB is a relational database, each table contains
        foreign keys to establish the different relationships between the
        tables. For example, a project within the database contains a study.
        This relationship is created thanks to the projectId, which is a
        foreign key that uniquely identifies a project (Project table row) to a
        study (Study table row).
