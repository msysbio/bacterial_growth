          <h2>Welcome to µGrowthDB</h2>

          <p>
            µGrowthDB is a relational database that provides a structure to store
            different types of microbial growth data. Our main objective is to
            serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers interested in
            studying the growth dynamics of microbial species by providing
            access to growth projects and studies uploaded by other researchers.
          </p>

          <h3>Search Growth Studies</h3>

          <p>
            Users can search for experimental data collected from microbial
            growth studies. The search can be filtered by different experimental
            conditions and characteristicas like project name, study name,
            microbial strains, metabolites, culture media and pH.
          </p>

          <p>
            All the data at µGrowthDB is publically available for everyone. To
            further analyze and compare different datasets we offer the feature
            of downloading several datasets at once.
          </p>

          <h3>Upload your Microbial Growth Project and Studies</h3>

          <p>
            At µGrowthDB, we recognize the invaluable contributions of
            researchers in advancing our understanding of microbial dynamics.
            Sharing growth data publicly plays a crucial role in increasing
            scientific progress and collaboration within the research community.
            We allow reasearcher to upload their experimental data by following
            five steps that allow us to keep an adquate quality control over the
            data.
          </p>

          <h3>Visualize Growth Data</h3>

          <p>
            Users can visualize all the different microbial growth experiments
            with its corresponding measured techniques in the database, this
            means plotting accurate growth curves accross different conditions.
