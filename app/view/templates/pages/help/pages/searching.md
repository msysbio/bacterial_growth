## Search form

On the search page, by default, you can see the 5 latest studies uploaded. You can enter a specific search query to find studies that match certain criteria.

<p>
    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" title="Form components" src="/static/images/help/searching/search-form.png" />
    </div>
</p>

You can use the dropdown to choose what your query will be matched with. For instance, if you have a specific study ID like "SMGDB00000002", you can enter that and pick "Study ID" to find the single study that has that identifier. You can also search by a study's **project**, or the microbial **strains** or **metabolites** that were used in a study.

By checking the "Advanced search" option, you can add multiple different clauses to your search, combined with "AND", "OR", or "NOT" logical operators to describe more specifically what study you're looking for.
