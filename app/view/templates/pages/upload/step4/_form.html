          Describe the physical containers of microbial communities as
          "compartments". For each different combination of environmental
          conditions, assign them a name and you'll associate these
          compartments to experiments in the next step.
        </p>

        <p>
          You might have a single compartment per vessel, but it's also
          possible to define e.g. broth and mucin beads floating inside as
          separate "compartments" that you measure separately as well. If you
          change environments e.g. by modifying pH from neutral to acidic, you
          can describe them as two separate compartments.
        </p>

        <p>
          To describe the medium, it is recommended to provide a link to
          {{ "https://mediadive.dsmz.de/media"|external_link("MediaDive") }}.
          You can define a custom medium using their
          {{ "https://mediadive.dsmz.de/docs/medium-builder"|external_link("medium builder") }}.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please keep the labels abbreviated, since they will be displayed as
          subscripts to biological replicates, e.g "BiorepA1<sub>C1</sub>".

          Define all communities included in your experiments based on the strains
          you entered in step 2. If you've missed a strain you use, you can go back
          to that step and add it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each experiment will be defined with a single community. If your
          experiment involves changing the species composition (e.g. adding a new
          strain) during the experiment, you will be able to describe that by
          adding a perturbation from one defined community to another.
