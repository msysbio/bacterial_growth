    <p>
      Organize the data you've entered so far into experiments. Each experiment
      has a single community, but may have multiple separate compartments that
      are being measured. Pick the time unit that you will use when upload
      measurements:
    </p>

    <div class="form-row flex-row">
      <label>

        {{ upload_form['timeUnits'](class='form-input-blue form-input-full') }}
      </label>
    </div>

    <p>
      For each experiment, name the biological replicates of the experimental
      design. These will show up as rows in the data spreadsheet.
